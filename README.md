## What is it?

This is a plugin for the Serverless framework that adds support for associating a Lambda
function with a CloudFront distribution to take advantage of the new Lambda@Edge features
of CloudFront.

Unfortunately CloudFormation does not currently support Lambda@Edge. I have opened a
[ticket with them](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=262327) and hope
they will eventually add support for it. Once they do, then the Serverless team can also
add support for it ([issue here](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/3944)).

A CloudFormation custom resource would not work well for this type of work because:

   1. The default policy that Serverless creates for Lambda functions won't work because
      when AWS replicates a function to be used for Lambda@Edge, it assigns it to
      different log group names than a typical Lambda function. Thus, the default policy
      needed to be updated before being submitted to CloudFormation
      * See https://github.com/silvermine/serverless-plugin-cloudfront-lambda-edge/blob/3605ad93766ce60014206b35b0bd1d44ee4f3427/src/index.js#L87-L105
   2. Similarly, the AssumeRolePolicy on the role that Serverless creates for the Lambda
      to execute in needs the principal `edgelambda.amazonaws.com` added (it has just
      `lambda.amazonaws.com`).
      * See https://github.com/silvermine/serverless-plugin-cloudfront-lambda-edge/blob/3605ad93766ce60014206b35b0bd1d44ee4f3427/src/index.js#L77-L85
   3. Also, the CloudFront distribution is managed by CloudFormation, and then for us to
      add our Lambda@Edge functions to it requires a second update. A custom resource
      can't take on management of a resource that's already managed within the stack, and
      we don't want to build a custom resource that has to entirely manage the CloudFront
      distribution.

Thus, the plugin will make the first two modifications to the CloudFormation template
before Serverless writes it. It will also remove any environment variables from the Lambda
function's CloudFormation resource because they are not supported by Lambda@Edge (it only
does this on functions that will be associated with a CloudFront distribution). Then after
the deploy is done, it will check to see if an update is needed to the CloudFront
distribution, and if so, will update it to reference the latest versions of the Lambda
function. Unfortunately this means that at times your CloudFront distribution will be
updated twice in a row - and CloudFront distributions are extremely slow to update
(approximately 15 minutes for each update). What can you do ðŸ¤·?

## A Few Other Things to Keep In Mind

1. As mentioned above, CloudFront distributions can take a long time to deploy,
so you probably want to keep this separate from other "normal" serverless services.
2. It does not appear that you can delete Lambda@Edge functions because they are replicated.
You'll see an error like `There was an error deleting this version: Lambda was unable to delete [some function ARN] because it is a replicated function.` Here are a few links about it:

    * https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=260242&tstart=0


## How do I use it?

There are three steps:

### Install the Plugin as a Development Dependency

```bash
npm install --save-dev --save-exact serverless-plugin-cloudfront-lambda-edge
```

### Telling Serverless to Use the Plugin

Simply add this plugin to the list of plugins in your `serverless.yml` file:

```yml
plugins:
   - serverless-plugin-cloudfront-lambda-edge
```

### Configuring Functions to Associate With CloudFront Distributions

Also in your `serverless.yml` file, you will modify your function definitions
to include a `lambdaAtEdge` property. That object will contain two key/value
pairs: `distribution` and `eventType`.

The `distribution` is the logical name used in your `Resources` section to
define the CloudFront distribution.

The `eventType` is one of the four Lambda@Edge event types:

   * viewer-request
   * origin-request
   * viewer-response
   * origin-response

For example:

```yml
functions:
   directoryRootOriginRequestRewriter:
      name: '${self:custom.objectPrefix}-origin-request'
      handler: src/DirectoryRootOriginRequestRewriteHandler.handler
      memorySize: 128
      timeout: 1
      lambdaAtEdge:
         distribution: 'WebsiteDistribution'
         eventType: 'origin-request'
```


## Example CloudFront Static Site Serverless Config

Here is an example of a `serverless.yml` file that configures an S3 bucket with a
CloudFront distribution and a Lambda@Edge function:

```yml
service: static-site

custom:
   defaultRegion: us-east-1
   defaultEnvironmentGroup: dev
   region: ${opt:region, self:custom.defaultRegion}
   stage: ${opt:stage, env:USER}
   objectPrefix: '${self:service}-${self:custom.stage}'

plugins:
   - serverless-plugin-cloudfront-lambda-edge

package:
   exclude:
      - 'node_modules/**'

provider:
   name: aws
   runtime: nodejs6.10 # Because this runs on CloudFront (lambda@edge) it must be 6.10
   region: ${self:custom.region}
   stage: ${self:custom.stage}
   # Note that Lambda@Edge does not actually support environment variables for lambda
   # functions, but the plugin will strip the environment variables from any function
   # that has edge configuration on it
   environment:
      SLS_SVC_NAME: ${self:service}
      SLS_STAGE: ${self:custom.stage}

functions:
   directoryRootOriginRequestRewriter:
      name: '${self:custom.objectPrefix}-origin-request'
      handler: src/DirectoryRootOriginRequestRewriteHandler.handler
      memorySize: 128
      timeout: 1
      lambdaAtEdge:
         distribution: 'WebsiteDistribution'
         eventType: 'origin-request'

resources:
   Resources:
      WebsiteBucket:
         Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
         Properties:
            BucketName: '${self:custom.objectPrefix}'
            AccessControl: 'PublicRead'
            WebsiteConfiguration:
               IndexDocument: 'index.html'
               ErrorDocument: 'error.html'
      WebsiteDistribution:
         Type: 'AWS::CloudFront::Distribution'
         Properties:
            DistributionConfig:
               DefaultCacheBehavior:
                  TargetOriginId: 'WebsiteBucketOrigin'
                  ViewerProtocolPolicy: 'redirect-to-https'
                  DefaultTTL: 600 # ten minutes
                  MaxTTL: 600 # ten minutes
                  Compress: true
                  ForwardedValues:
                     QueryString: false
                     Cookies:
                        Forward: 'none'
               DefaultRootObject: 'index.html'
               Enabled: true
               PriceClass: 'PriceClass_100'
               HttpVersion: 'http2'
               ViewerCertificate:
                  CloudFrontDefaultCertificate: true
               Origins:
                  -
                     Id: 'WebsiteBucketOrigin'
                     DomainName: { 'Fn::GetAtt': [ 'WebsiteBucket', 'DomainName' ] }
                     S3OriginConfig: {}
```

And here is an example function that would go with this Serverless template:

```js
'use strict';

module.exports = {

   // invoked by CloudFront (origin requests)
   handler: function(evt, context, cb) {
      var req = evt.Records[0].cf.request;

      if (req.uri && req.uri.length && req.uri.substring(req.uri.length - 1) === '/') {
         console.log('changing "%s" to "%s"', req.uri, req.uri + 'index.html');
         req.uri = req.uri + 'index.html';
      }

      cb(null, req);
   },

};
```
